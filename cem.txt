<h1>About Chemical Engineering Department</h1>
 <p>The Department of Chemical Engineering was founded in 1977. Now it has grown over to 10 Faculty, roughly 25 PG Students and 282 UG students and numerous research and support staff. Through its curriculum, disciplined approach and sustained urge to excel, the Department earned its rightful place among the good Chemical Engineering Departments in the country. Department of Chemical Engineering, with 122 papers and total citation of 973, is ranked 7 in South Zone and 17 in India based on publication output during the year 1998-2008.
The Department of Chemical Engineering started UG Program with an intake of 15 which increased to 30 in 1992, later it is increased to 40 in 2002, then intake is 60 which is increased in 2013 and now the intake is 66 which is increased in 2019. The Department started PG Program in 1992 with an intake of 18 and now the intake is 25.</p>
 <p>In 45 years of history, over 2150 graduates and 320 post graduates got trained , 13 doctorates were awarded, one Indo-US workshop, one STTP, three National Workshops, nine conferences and 15 Guest lectures conducted, over 190 technical papers and 3 minor projects successfully completed. two UGC –MRP, two AICTE-MODROBs, and one Network scheme executed.
The Department of Chemical Engineering organizes National level student conference in the name of Chemosphere every year. About 30 technical papers are presented at various student level conferences every year, consistent good performance at GATE (All India Fifth rank – 2008 and FIRST rank - 2009). Twenty National Student level conferences – CHEMOSPHERE were organized. Alumni were well placed in core and software industries and went on for higher studies.</p>
